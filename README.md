The plots folder contains all of the graphs created for the analysis.  
The file Report.html contains all the graphs in the form of a coherent report.  
The folder scripts contains a script to create each graph. The names of the plots coincide with the names of the scripts.  
The file poster.pdf is a shorter, static version of the report in A0 format.
